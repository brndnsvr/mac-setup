## üîß Customization Options

### Minimal Installation
Only install essential tools, skip optional ones:
```bash
./setup.sh --roles backend --minimal
```

### Full Installation
Install everything including optional tools:
```bash
./setup.sh --roles backend --full
```

### Skip Specific Categories
```bash
./setup.sh --roles backend --skip databases,testing
```

### Non-Interactive Mode
Perfect for automation:
```bash
./setup.sh --roles backend,devops --non-interactive
```

### Dry Run
See what would be installed without installing:
```bash
./setup.sh --roles backend --dry-run
```

## üîç Not Sure Which Role?

### Use the Setup Wizard
Let us help you choose:
```bash
./setup-wizard.sh
```

### Analyze Your Current Setup
If you already have tools installed:
```bash
./suggest-roles.sh
```

### Browse All Tools
See everything available:
```bash
cat APPLIST.md | less
```

## üì¶ What's Next?

After installation:

1. **Restart your terminal** or run:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

2. **Check installation**:
   ```bash
   ./health-check.sh
   ```

3. **View your custom commands**:
   ```bash
   dev-help
   ```

4. **Create a new project**:
   ```bash
   new-project my-app     # General project
   new-ai-project my-bot  # AI project
   new-python-project api # Python project
   ```

## ‚ö° Quick Tips

- **Choose one terminal**: When prompted, pick either Warp (modern) or iTerm2 (traditional)
- **Choose one editor**: VS Code, Cursor (AI-powered), or Zed (performance)
- **Skip optional tools**: You can always install them later
- **Use presets**: Faster than selecting individual roles
- **Export your setup**: `./setup.sh --export my-setup.json` to replicate later

## üÜò Need Help?

- **Detailed documentation**: See [README.md](README.md)
- **Role descriptions**: Check [APPLIST.md](APPLIST.md)
- **Troubleshooting**: Run `./health-check.sh`
- **List installed tools**: `./manage-packages.sh list`

## üöÑ Express Setup
